Machine Language Elements

Specification:

Operations:
	Arithmetic:
		ADD
		SUBTRACT
		ETC..
	Logical:
		And
		Or
	Flow:
		GOTO...
		IF


Operands:
	Datatypes
	Size

Data registers (Hold data)

Address Registers (Store address as a variable)

Addressing Modes:

	Register:
	Add R1, R2 (Put the sum of r1 and r2 into r2)

	Direct:
	Add R1, M[200] (Same idea
	
	Indirect:
	Add R1, @A (Same idea, add to the address stored in A)

	Immediate:
	Add 73, R1 (Add 73 to whatever is in R1)


Flow Control:

	Usually Sequential
	
	Jump to another instruction

	101 LoadR1, 0
	102 Add 1, R1
	103 ...
	156 Jump 102
	
	Simple loop

	We can name the address with a variable to make it easier

	Conditional Jumps:
	
	Only jump if some condition is met.

	Example: We want to perform some calculation on the absolute value of a register. We want to absolute the number in order to continue:

		JGT R1, 0, cont // Jump if R1 is greater than 0
		Subtract R1, 0, R1 // R1 <- (0 - R1)

		cont:
		//Some other code
